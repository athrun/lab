In order to run this script you must:

1. Install Python 2.6.6 or later
2. Install VMware vSphere CLI
3. Change the IIS server configuration on the PlateSpin Server so that both Integrated Windows 
Authentication and Basic Authentication are enabled for the PortabilitySuite website (v8) or for
the PlatespinMigrate website (v9). This can be easily done from the IIS management console.

Edit the configuration variables at beginning of the file to suit your environment.

This part should be easy enough.
